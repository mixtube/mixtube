  Sadly, your device lacks some required features to make it a MixTube playback device.
  For now, you can only display the content of the queue, not more. However, you will be soon able to use your
  device as a remote to add tracks to a running MixTube queue.

  Stay tuned...

  intervention. It is sadly the policy for most "mobile" browsers these days (tablet included) and this will not
  change anytime soon.
