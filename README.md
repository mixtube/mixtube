# Mixtube

Mixtube is a web application that let you create queues of videos and automatically cross-fades them so that you get a continuous stream of music. The only compatible video provider for now is YouTube but more will be added.

## Getting started
For now, the only way to try Mixtube is to clone the GitHub repo and visit the index page through a web server.

The grunt script can help you with that. You need NodeJS grunt and bower installed on your machine. Then execute:
```
npm install
gulp serve
```

The server should be running by now and you can access MixTube at http://localhost:3000
